For example, an IT manager may have attributes granting them access to IT resources and management-level resources.</li><li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong>: DAC allows the owner of an asset to manage access to that asset via an ACL. This is the default access control model used by most operating systems.</li><li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: RBAC defines groups based on various roles and assigns privileges to these groups. Users are assigned to a group and inherit the privileges associated with it. Group Policies in Windows use RBAC. RBAC is good for protecting against privilege creep because removing a user from a group removes all the associated permissions.</li><li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: MAC assigns classification labels to subjects and objects that are used to govern access. The Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret system with compartments within each used by some governments is an example of MAC.</li></ul>"

This approach ensures that each stage is fully completed before the next but is rigid and inflexible.</li><li><strong>Agile</strong>: Agile is a high-level set of principles adopted by many development methodologies, such as Extreme Programming (XP), Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Scrum. Agile is built around sprints, which make frequent, small changes to software rather than a single, monolithic development cycle.</li><li><strong>DevOps</strong>: DevOps methodologies use automation to streamline and expedite software development, testing, and deployment. By integrating development, QA, and ops teams and using automation, DevOps enables rapid release cycles.</li><li><strong>DevSecOps</strong>: DevSecOps integrates security more fully into DevOps processes and the SDLC. DevSecOps explicitly defines security requirements for software and builds security testing into automated CI/CD pipelines.</li></ul>"

These vulnerabilities are scored using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which helps in identifying how severe the vulnerability is.</li><li><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>: Penetration testing includes vulnerability assessments but also attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities that they discover.

Some of the main types include:</p><ul><li><strong>Breach and Attack Simulations (BAS)</strong>: BAS platforms are designed to perform automated penetration testing. They introduce Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) into the system \u2013 malicious files, C2 traffic, etc. \u2013 and check if the corporate security controls identify it.</li><li><strong>Vulnerability Assessments</strong>: Vulnerability assessments use automated tools to identify vulnerabilities within an organization\u2019s systems, including networks, web applications, and databases. Typically these check an application against the list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to identify known issues. These vulnerabilities are scored using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which helps in identifying how severe the vulnerability is.</li><li><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>: Penetration testing includes vulnerability assessments but also attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities that they discover. Additionally, they involve more manual testing than a fully automated vulnerability scan.</li><li><strong>Compliance Checks</strong>: Compliance checks verify that an organization implements the security controls required by applicable regulations and that they are functional.</li></ul>"
