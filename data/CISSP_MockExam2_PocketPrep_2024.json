They occur when too much data is provided, and the allocated memory space overflows. This generally causes the program to crash, and in some circumstances, the attacker can replace legitimate code execution with their own set of instructions. Software developers should incorporate bounds checks to ensure user input is an acceptable length.</p><p>A memory leak attack is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a computer program or application fails to release allocated memory properly after it is no longer needed.

The IV is used to reduce the likelihood of the same plaintext patterns from being found in the ciphertext. The IV is used to randomize the plaintext before it is encrypted with the symmetric key. Increasing the size of the encryption key makes it harder to brute force the key and decrypt data, but it has no impact on altering patterns.</p><p>When a symmetric block algorithm is used, it can be placed in one of a number of different modes. The Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode is the only one that does not use an IV or something similar. So, all patterns that are in the plaintext would exist and be discoverable in the ciphertext.</p><p>Stream ciphers do not use an IV, they function in a different manner from the block algorithms. These are very difficult to create and also difficult to implement in software properly. Therefore, in general, they are not the solution to the patterns in the plaintext.</p><p>One of the reasons Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was weak was that it used a short 24-bit IV.

This causes devices on the network to send an ICMP reply to the victim for each ICMP request sent by the attacker. This overwhelms the victim and can cause the system to crash. A smurf attack is a Denial of Service attack (DoS).</p><p>In a SYN flood attack, the attacker floods the target server with a large number of SYN packets, typically spoofing the source IP addresses to make it appear as though the requests are coming from legitimate clients. However, the attacker does not complete the handshake process by sending the final ACK packet to establish the connection. As a result, the target server is left waiting for the final ACK packet, tying up system resources and preventing it from processing legitimate connection requests.</p><p>A buffer overflow attack is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer, or temporary storage area, than it can hold. Buffers are allocated a fixed amount of memory, and if a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer size, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations. This overflow can corrupt data, crash the program, or, more dangerously, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p><p>In a land attack, the attacker sends a spoofed TCP SYN packet with the source IP address set to the same IP address as the target system as well as the same port number for both the source and destination ports. This creates a situation where the target system receives a packet that appears to come from itself. When the target system attempts to process the packet, it enters into an infinite loop of responding to itself, causing it to become overwhelmed and unable to process legitimate network traffic.</p>"

Every resource is classified with a label, and users cannot access resources unless they have an equal or greater clearance level. MAC is widely used in government and military environments. MAC is often referred to as a <i>lattice-based model</i> because it looks like a garden lattice with well-defined boundaries when it is represented on paper. MAC is commonly associated with the Bell-LaPadula access control model, which is a lattice-based model.</p><p>Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a security model that allows users or administrators to set permissions and control access to resources based on the discretion of the resource owner. In DAC, resource owners determine who can access their resources and what level of access they have, such as read, write, execute, or delete permissions. This model relies on the owner's discretion to manage access rights and does not impose strict hierarchical control.</p><p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts system access to authorized users based on their roles within an organization. In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to specific roles based on their job responsibilities or functions. This approach simplifies access management by centralizing permissions around roles rather than individual users. It enhances security by ensuring that users only have access to resources necessary for their roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.</p><p>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is a security model that grants access to resources based on attributes associated with users, devices, and other entities. Unlike traditional access control models that rely on roles, ABAC considers various attributes such as user roles, job titles, department, location, time of access, device type, and user behavior.</p>"

Organizations often fail to build and maintain comprehensive supply chain risk management programs. Some of the most impactful and elaborate cybersecurity attacks were supply chain attacks. It is becoming more critical than ever to require an organization's suppliers to meet an acceptable level of security to reduce the likelihood of a supply chain attack. The US government is beginning to require that all defense contractors meet a minimum level of cybersecurity requirements that will be audited. These requirements must also be flowed to all downstream and upstream suppliers of the organization that wins the contract.</p><p>Below are some famous supply chain attacks:</p><ul><li>2013 Target Credit Card disclosure. Attackers exploited a third-party HVAC company that Target used. The HVAC company had devices on the Target corporate network that attackers exploited to gain access to Target's network.</li><li>As previsouly mentioned, 2019 and 2020 SolarWinds Orion attack. Attackers injected code into a trusted product that was widely deployed.</li><li>2021 Kaseya VSA attack. VSA is a product used by IT companies to manage their customers' computers and systems.

Ransomware attacks are typically carried out by cybercriminals seeking financial gain and can have devastating consequences for individuals, businesses, and organizations.</p><p>A zero-day attack is a cyberattack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware for which no patch or fix is available. The term <i>zero-day</i> refers to the fact that the vulnerability is exploited on the same day it becomes known to the public or to the software vendor, giving them <i>zero days</i> to respond or provide a fix.</p><p>An integrity attack, also known as <i>data tampering</i>, is a type of cyberattack that aims to modify, alter, or corrupt data in a way that compromises its integrity. The goal of such attacks is often to manipulate data to achieve unauthorized changes, cause confusion, or undermine trust in the integrity of the information.

One-time pad requires a completely random key that is the same length as the message. Each bit of the message and the key are eXclusive-OR (XOR) together. The resulting ciphertext is considered unbreakable by brute force (it is suseptible to other attack methods) as long as the key remains secure. For a one-time pad to be implemented correctly, keys cannot be reused and must truly be random.</p><p>The following are one-time pad requirements:</p><ul><li>Keys must be genuinely random values.</li><li>Keys can only be used one time.</li><li>Keys must be exchanged securely.</li><li>The sender and receiver must keep the keys secure.</li><li>The key must be the same length as the message.</li></ul><p>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 is a commonly used symmetric algorithm.

Key loggers are extremely difficult to detect since they are presented to the operating system as a keyboard. Security managers should periodically sweep their environments and look for unauthorized devices such as key loggers.</p><p>Stealing documents from the shred bin is not that likely to reveal any user credentials; it could, but a key logger definitely would uncover those credentials.</p><p>Brute forcing the credentials from an open workstation has two problems. It is more likely that someone will question why the penetration tester is there before they succeed in brute forcing the password. Brute force in this scenario is to guess one password after the next until one is found to work from the user's interface. The second problem is that there is likely that the account will be locked after just three or five tries, requiring many visits back to keep trying.</p><p>Attempting to connect to the network will not reveal the user's credentials.
