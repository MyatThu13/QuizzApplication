This ensures that the alternate site can complete its duties while minimizing the potential impact on normal operations.</li><li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: In a walkthrough, the team physically performs the actions described in the plan (unless they would disrupt operations). This can build familiarity and help identify parts of the plan that are impossible or require additional resources.</li><li><strong>Simulation</strong>: In a simulation like a fire drill, the team is given a scenario and tasked with responding to it. This is more realistic than a walkthrough but can be more disruptive to operations since tasks are actually completed.</li><li><strong>Full-Interruption Test</strong>: A full-interruption test actually switches operations over from the primary to the recovery site. This is more disruptive and risky than a parallel test but actually verifies that the organization\u2019s failover processes work.</li><li><strong>Read-through/Tabletop</strong>: A read-through or tabletop exercise involves reading through and role-playing the disaster response plan.

An organization may choose to delete user accounts or simply lock them to ensure that useful data is preserved. It should also collect any company-owned devices from the former employee.</li><li><strong>Account Maintenance</strong>: Account maintenance involves reviewing and updating rights and privileges to ensure that they are aligned with a user\u2019s current needs.</li><li><strong>Service Accounts Management</strong>: Service accounts are used by applications instead of users. They need certain levels of access, which should be tailored to their role rather than using over-privileged built-in accounts.</li><li><strong>Provisioning</strong>: Provisioning is the process of creating accounts for a new user. This typically includes enrollment/registration (collecting username and other data about the user), proofing (verifying the identity of the user via photo ID and other means), and establishing the user\u2019s identity by creating required accounts and assigning necessary privileges. Provisioning also may include issuing devices and having users sign off on necessary corporate policies.</li><li><strong>Role Definition and Transition</strong>: As employees grow and the company changes, new roles may need to be created or assigned. For example, an employee promoted to management will need new access granted to them and some privileges removed. The company may also need to create or update roles to support new types of employees or corporate systems.</li><li><strong>Account Access Review</strong>: Administrators should regularly review accounts to ensure that they have appropriate privileges and are not inactive. Privilege-related issues include excessive privileges (like unneeded administrator-level access) and privilege creep (acquiring and retaining unneeded privileges as job roles change).</li><li><strong>Privilege Escalation</strong>: Privilege escalation involves moving to a higher privilege level via the use of sudo or similar means.

This is the cheapest, least disruptive, and least realistic form of testing. This would not involve an employee driving to the alternate site as part of the exercise.</li><li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: In a walkthrough, the team physically performs the actions described in the plan (unless they would disrupt operations). This can build familiarity and help identify parts of the plan that are impossible or require additional resources.</li><li><strong>Simulation</strong>: In a simulation like a fire drill, the team is given a scenario and tasked with responding to it. This is more realistic than a walkthrough but can be more disruptive to operations since tasks are actually completed.</li><li><strong>Parallel Test</strong>: Parallel tests perform normal business operations at an alternate as well as the primary site. This ensures that the alternate site can complete its duties while minimizing the potential impact on normal operations.</li><li><strong>Full-Interruption Test</strong>: A full-interruption test actually switches operations over from the primary to the recovery site. This is more disruptive and risky than a parallel test but actually verifies that the organization\u2019s failover processes work.</li></ul>"

This is the default access control model used by most operating systems and is the only decentralized access management scheme. DAC does not implement centralized access management.</p><p>Other models that manage access control are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: RBAC defines groups based on various roles and assigns privileges to these groups. Users are assigned to a group and inherit the privileges associated with it. Group Policies in Windows use RBAC. RBAC is good for protecting against privilege creep because removing a user from a group removes all of the associated permissions.</li><li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: ABAC defines and assigns various attributes to users, and access to resources is governed based on combinations of attributes. For example, an IT manager may have attributes granting them access to IT resources and management-level resources.</li><li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: MAC assigns classification labels to subjects and objects that are used to govern access. The Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret system with compartments within each used by some governments is an example of MAC.</li><li><strong>Rule-Based Access Control</strong>: Rule-based access controls define rules that govern access to a system. Firewalls are an example of a system that uses rule-based access control to manage traffic flowing through it.</li><li><strong>Risk-Based Access Control</strong>: Risk-based access control assesses the risk posed by a request before granting or denying it. For example, some resources may only be accessible from on-prem networks or trusted devices.</li></ul>"

RBAC is good for protecting against privilege creep because removing a user from a group removes all the associated permissions.</p><p>These other models can also manage access control:</p><ul><li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong>: DAC allows the owner of an asset to manage access to that asset via an ACL. This is the default access control model used by most operating systems.</li><li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: ABAC defines and assigns various attributes to users, and access to resources is governed based on combinations of attributes. For example, an IT manager may have attributes granting them access to IT resources and management-level resources.</li><li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>: MAC assigns classification labels to subjects and objects that are used to govern access.

The switch will isolate traffic based on the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address that the frame is being sent to.</p><p>Firewalls are designed to block or allow traffic to pass based on the configured rules (or policies). Firewalls operate at layer 3 if it uses the IP address to make decisions or layer 4 if it uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port to make decisions. Firewalls could also operate at layer 5 or layer 7. The firewall operates in a top-down manner, first matching the incoming packet to the top rule. If the packet or contained data matches the rule, the designated rule (block or allow) is followed. If it does not match the first rule, it is compared to the second rule and so on. The final rule should block all other traffic.</p><p>A router operates at layer 3. The router will route traffic out specific ports based on the IP destination address in the IP packet.

Asymmetric is used to exchange symmetric keys as well as validate the identity of the server and possibly the client. Once the symmetric keys are exchanged, the web traffic can be transmitted securely. The Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) algorithm is the only algorithm in the list of answer options that is symmetric in nature.</p><p>Diffie-Hellman (DH) is the first asymmetric algorithm invented. It was defined by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in their paper \"New Directions in Cryptography\" that they wrote in 1976. It is an algorithm designed to negotiate the symmetric key between two endpoints. It is still commonly in use, but sometimes in the improved Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) format. DH by itself is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm is the second asymmetric algorithm and was defined by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1977.

This simulates an attack by an external attacker with no knowledge of the target environment.</li><li><strong>Gray-Box</strong>: Gray-box testing provides the tester with limited information about the test environment.
