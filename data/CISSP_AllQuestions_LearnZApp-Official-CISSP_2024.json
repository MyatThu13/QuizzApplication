A CASB is designed to sit between a cloud environment and the users who use it, and it provides monitoring and policy enforcement capabilities. A next-generation firewall (NGFW), an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a security operations and response (SOAR) tool could each provide some insight into what is going on, but they are not purpose built and designed for this like the CASB is. The NGFW and IDS are most likely to provide insight into traffic patterns and behaviors, while the SOAR is primarily intended to monitor other systems and centralize data for response, making it potentially the least useful in this specific scenario."

Unplugging devices that are needed for protection does not resolve the need to keep them online."

This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups that don't need to be able to access each other's systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross-network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!"

An IPS might detect an attacker's redirect, but tracking the multitude of load-balanced servers most large providers use can be challenging, if not impossible.

During a parallel test, the team actually activates the disaster recovery site for testing, but the primary site remains operational. During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive."

Separation of duties applied to a situation like this one might say that the same person may not have both the ability to initiate a request and the ability to approve a request.

During a full interruption test, the team takes down the primary site and confirms that the disaster recovery site is capable of handling regular operations. The full interruption test is the most thorough test but also the most disruptive. The checklist review is the least disruptive type of disaster recovery test. During a checklist review, team members each review the contents of their disaster recovery checklists on their own and suggest any necessary changes. During a tabletop exercise, team members come together and walk through a scenario without making any changes to information systems."

The rest of the settings are problematic. For example, cookies are vulnerable to DNS spoofing. Domain cookies should usually have the narrowest possible scope, which is actually accomplished by not setting the Domain cookie. This allows only the originating server to access the cookie. Cookies without the Expires or Max-age attributes are ephemeral and will only be kept for the session, making them less vulnerable than stored cookies. Normally, the HTTP Only attribute is a good idea, but it prevents scripting rather than requiring unencrypted HTTP sessions."

As these devices are increasingly embedded in buildings and infrastructure, the support model and security model are important to understand. Both the lack of separate administrative access and the lack of strong encryption can be addressed by placing the IoT devices on a dedicated subnet or network that prevents other users from accessing the devices directly. This will help limit the risk without undue expense or complexity and is a common practice. Finally, lack of storage space can be a concern, but is not the most important when looking at the risks IoT devices can create."

Simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) still uses a password, but it no longer encrypts and sends that password across the connection to perform authentication. Instead, SAE performs a zero-knowledge proof process known as Dragonfly Key Exchange, which is itself a derivative of Diffie–Hellman. IEEE 802.1X defines port-based network access control that ensures that clients can't communicate with a resource until proper authentication has taken place. It's based on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) from Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). However, this is the technology behind the label of ENT; thus, it is not an option in this scenario. IEEE 802.1q defines the use of virtual local area network (VLAN) tags and thus is not relevant to Wi-Fi authentication. Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) is a Cisco protocol proposed to replace Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP), which is now obsolete, thanks to the development of WPA2, and is not supported in WPA3 either."

      "explanation": "The CSO in this scenario is demonstrating the need to follow the security principle of change management. Change management usually involves extensive planning, testing, logging, auditing, and monitoring of activities related to security controls and mechanisms. This scenario is not describing a BCP event. A BCP event would involve the evaluation of threats to business processes and then the creation of response scenarios to address those issues. This scenario is not describing onboarding. Onboarding is the process of integrating a new element (such as an employee or device) into an existing system of security infrastructure. Although loosely similar to change management, onboarding focuses more on ensuring compliance with existing security policies by the new member, rather than testing updates for an existing member. Static analysis is used to evaluate source code as a part of a secure development environment. Static analysis may be used as an evaluation tool in change management, but it is a tool, not the principle of security referenced in this scenario."

      "explanation": "The two main types of token devices are TOTP and HOTP. Time-based one-time password (TOTP) tokens or synchronous dynamic password tokens are devices or applications that generate passwords at fixed time intervals, such as every 60 seconds. Thus, TOTP produces new time-derived passwords on a specific time interval that can be used only a single time when attempting to authenticate. HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP) tokens or asynchronous dynamic password tokens are devices or applications that generate passwords not based on fixed time intervals but instead based on a nonrepeating one-way function, such as a hash or hash message authentication code (HMAC—a type of hash that uses a symmetric key in the hashing process) operation. HMAC is a hashing function, not a means to authenticate. Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) is used to create authentication federation (i.e. sharing) links; it is not itself a means to authenticate."

      "explanation": "The most important security concern from this list of options in relation to a CSP is the data retention policy. The data retention policy defines what information or data is being collected by the CSP, how long it will be kept, how it is destroyed, why it is kept, and who can access it. The number of customers and what hardware is used are not significant security concerns in comparison to data retention. Whether the CSP offers MaaS, IDaaS, and SaaS is not as important as data retention, especially if these are not services your organization needs or wants. One of the keys to answering this question is to consider the range of CSP options, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and the type of organizations that are technically CSP SaaS but that we don't often think of as such (examples include Facebook, Google, and Amazon). These organizations absolutely have access to customer/user data, and thus, their data retention policies are of utmost concern (at least compared to the other options provided)."

      "correctAnswerId": "a1",
      "explanation": "Programmers need to adopt secure coding practices, which include using stored procedures, code signing, and server-side validation. A stored procedure is a subroutine or software module that can be called on or accessed by applications interacting with a relational database management system (RDBMS). Code signing is the activity of crafting a digital signature of a software program in order to confirm that it was not changed and who it is from. Server-side data validation is suited for protecting a system against input submitted by a malicious user. Using immutable systems is not a secure coding technique; instead, an immutable system is a server or software product that, once configured and deployed, is never altered in place. File size optimization may be efficient but is not necessarily a secure coding technique. Using third-party software libraries may reduce workload to minimize the amount of new code to author, but third-party software libraries are a risk because they can introduce vulnerabilities, especially when closed source libraries are used. Thus, use of third-party software libraries is not a secure coding technique unless the security posture of the externally sourced code is verified, which was not mentioned as an answer option."

Once the worker is fired, the company has little direct control over that person. So, the only remaining leverage is legal, which often relates to a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). Hopefully, reviewing and reminding the ex-employee about their signed NDA will reduce future security issues, such as confidential data dissemination. Returning the exiting employee's personal belongings is not really an important task to protect the company's security interests. Evaluating the exiting employee's performance could be done via an exit interview, but that was not mentioned in this scenario. Often when an adversarial termination occurs, an exit interview is not feasible. Canceling an exiting employee's parking permit is not a high security priority for most organizations, at least not in comparison to the NDA."

      "explanation": "The leaking of company proprietary data may have been caused by the content of emails received by workers. The computers of workers who clicked links from the suspicious emails may have been infected by malicious code. This malicious code may have exfiltrated documents to the social media site. This issue could occur whether workers were on company computers on the company network, on company computers on their home network, or on personal computers on their home network (especially if the workers copied company files to their personal machines to work from home). Blocking access to social media sites and personal email services from the company network reduces the risk of this same event occurring again. For example, if the suspicious emails are blocked from being received by company email servers and accounts, they could still be received into personal email accounts. Though not mentioned, blocking access to the malicious URLs would be a good security defense as well. This issue is not addressed by deploying a web application firewall, updating the company email server, using MFA on the email server, or performing an access review of company files. Although all of these options are good security practices in general, they do not relate specifically to this issue."

Training is typically hosted by an organization and is targeted to groups of employees with similar job functions. (A) Education is an endeavor in which students and users learn much more than they actually need to know to perform their work tasks. Education is most often associated with users pursuing certification or seeking job promotion or career advancement. Most education programs are not hosted by the employer but by training organizations or colleges or universities. Education is not provided to workers in groups based on their job positions. (B) Awareness establishes a common baseline or foundation of security understanding across the entire organization and focuses on key or basic topics and issues related to security that all employees must understand. Although it is provided by the organization, it is not targeted to groups of workers since it applies to all employees. (D) Termination is usually targeted at individuals rather than groups of workers with similar job positions. Though large layoff events might fire groups of similar workers, this option is not as accurate as training."

Gamification is a means to encourage compliance and engagement by integrating common elements of game play into other activities, such as security compliance and behavior change. This can include rewarding compliance behaviors and potentially punishing violating behaviors. Many aspects of game play can be integrated into security training and adoption, such as scoring points, earning achievements or badges (i.e., earn recognition), competing with others, cooperating with others (i.e., team up with coworkers), following a set of common/standard rules, having a defined goal, seeking rewards, developing group stories/experiences, and avoiding pitfalls or negative game events. (A) Program effectiveness evaluation is using some means of verification, such as giving a quiz or monitoring security incident rate changes over time, to measure whether the training is beneficial or a waste of time and resources. This question starts by indicating that security incidents are on the rise, which shows that prior training was ineffective. But the recommendations to change the training are gamification focused. (B) Onboarding is the process of adding new employees to the organization. This is not the concept being described in this scenario.

Static RAM and dynamic RAM are types of real memory and thus are all the same concept in relation to being volatile—meaning they lose any data they were holding when power is lost or cycled. Static RAM is faster and more costly, and dynamic RAM requires regular refreshing of the stored contents.

Unauthorized user access, identity spoofing, and poor authentication are potential weaknesses of most systems; they are not unique to DCE solutions.

It is the conversion or transformation of a capability of one web application into a microservice that can be called upon by numerous other web applications. The relationship to an application programming interface (API) is that each microservice must have a clearly defined (and secured!) API to allow for I/O between multi-microservices as well as to and from other applications. The other options are incorrect since they are not derivatives of SOA. Cyber-physical systems are devices that offer a computational means to control something in the physical world.

Instead, each application is placed into a container that includes only the actual resources needed to support the enclosed application, and the common or shared OS elements are then part of the hypervisor. The system as a whole could be redeployed using a containerization solution, and each of the applications previously present in the original seven VMs could be placed into containers, as well as the six new applications. This should result in all 13 applications being able to operate reasonably well without the need for new hardware.

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a change in how hardware management is perceived and handled. Instead of seeing hardware configuration as a manual, direct hands-on, one-on-one administration hassle, it is viewed as just another collection of elements to be managed in the same way that software and code are managed under DevSecOps (security, development, and operations). Serverless architecture is a cloud computing concept where code is managed by the customer, and the platform (i.e., supporting hardware and software) or server is managed by the CSP.

An Arduino device has limited RAM, a single USB port, and I/O pins for controlling additional electronics (such as servo motors or LED lights), and does not include an OS or support networking. Instead, Arduino can execute C++ programs specifically written to its limited instruction set. Raspberry Pi is a popular example of a 64-bit microcontroller or a single-board computer, which includes its own custom OS, although many third-party OS alternatives are available. A Raspberry Pi, another microcontroller option, has significantly more processing power than Arduino, is not limited to executing C++ programs, supports networking, and is more expensive than Arduino. Thus, a Raspberry Pi is not the best option for this scenario. A real-time operating system (RTOS) is designed to process or handle data as it arrives on the system with minimal latency or delay. RTOS is a software OS that is usually stored and executed from ROM and thus may be part of an embedded solution or hosted on a microcontroller. An RTOS is designed for mission-critical operations where delay must be eliminated or minimized for safety. Thus, RTOS is not the best option for this scenario since it is about managing a garden, which does not need real-time mission-critical operations. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a flexible computing device intended to be programmed by the end user or customer. FPGAs are often used as embedded devices in a wide range of products, including industrial control systems (ICSs).

      "explanation": "The risk of a lost or stolen laptop is the data loss, not the loss of the system itself, but the value of the data on the system, whether business related or personal. Thus, keeping minimal sensitive data on the system is the only way to reduce the risk. Hard drive encryption, cable locks, and strong passwords, although good ideas, are preventive tools, not means of reducing risk. They don't keep intentional and malicious data compromise from occurring; instead, they encourage honest people to stay honest. Hard drive encryption can be bypassed using the cold boot attack or by taking advantage of an encryption service flaw or configuration mistake. Cable locks can be cut or ripped out of the chassis. Strong passwords do not prevent the theft of a device, and password cracking and/or credential stuffing may be able to overcome the protection. If not, the drive could be extracted and connected to another system to access files directly, even with the native OS running."

A corporate-owned mobile strategy is when the company purchases mobile devices that can support compliance with the security policy. These devices are to be used exclusively for company purposes, and users should not perform any personal tasks on them. This option often requires workers to carry a second device for personal use. Corporate-owned clearly assigns responsibility for device oversight to the organization. The other three options still allow for co-mingling of data and have unclear or vague security responsibility assignments as a concept or policy basis. BYOD is a policy that allows employees to bring their own personal mobile devices to work and use those devices to connect to business resources and/or the internet through the company network. The concept of corporate-owned, personally enabled (COPE) means the organization purchases devices and provides them to employees. Each user is then able to customize the device and use it for both work activities and personal activities. The concept of choose your own device (CYOD) provides users with a list of approved devices from which to select the device to implement."

Although cellular service is encrypted from device to tower, there is a risk of being fooled by a false or rogue tower. A rogue tower could offer only plaintext connections, but even if it supported encrypted transactions, the encryption only applies to the radio transmissions between the device and the tower. Once the communication is on the tower, it will be decrypted, allowing for eavesdropping and content manipulation. Even without a rogue tower, eavesdropping can occur across the cellular carrier's interior network as well as across the internet, unless a VPN link is established between the remote mobile device and the network of the organization James works for. Being able to establish a connection can be unreliable depending on exactly where James's travel takes him. 3G, 4G, and 5G coverage is not 100 percent available everywhere. 5G coverage is the most limited since it is the latest technology and still not universally deployed, and each 5G tower covers less area than a 4G tower. If James is able to establish a connection, 4G and 5G speeds should be sufficient for most remote technician activities, since 4G supports 100 Mbps for mobile devices and 5G supports up to 10 Gbps. If connectivity is established, there should be no issues with cloud interaction or duplex conversations."

File encryption could be an issue, but the scenario mentions that groups of people work on projects and typically file encryption is employed by individuals, not by groups. Whole-drive encryption would be more appropriate for group-accessed files as well as for a SAN in general. This issue is not related to what SAN technology is used, such as Fibre Channel.

A MAC flooding attack is limited by network segmentation to the local switch, but the malware took advantage of weak or poor configuration on the switch and was still successful.

Stateful inspection firewalls make access control decisions based on the content and context of communications, but are not typically limited to a single application-layer protocol. Circuit-level firewalls are able to make permit and deny decisions in regard to circuit establishment either based on simple rules for IP and port, using captive portals, requiring port authentication via 802.1X, or more complex elements such as context- or attribute-based access control. Static packet-filtering firewalls filter traffic by examining data from a message header. Usually, the rules are concerned with source and destination IP address (layer 3) and port numbers (layer 4)."

      "explanation": "The issue in this scenario is that a private IP address from RFC 1918 is assigned to the web server. RFC 1918 addresses are not internet routable or accessible because they are reserved for private or internal use only. So, even with the domain name linked to the address, any attempt to access it from an internet location will fail. Local access via jumpbox or LAN system likely uses an address in the same private IP address range and has no issues locally. The issue of the scenario (i.e., being unable to access a website using its FQDN)  could be resolved by either using a public IP address or implementing static NAT on the screened subnet's boundary firewall. The jumpbox would not prevent access to the website regardless of whether it was rebooted, in active use, or turned off. That would only affect Michael's use of it from his desktop workstation. Split-DNS does support internet-based domain name resolution; it separates internal-only domain information from external domain information. A web browser should be compatible with the coding of most websites. Since there was no mention of custom coding and the site was intended for public use, it is probably using standard web technologies. Also, since Michael's workstation and several worker desktops could access the website, the problem is probably not related to the browser."

They further advise you that an avalanche would completely destroy your building. Your business insurance will cover the loss, but such coverage would require you to rebuild on the same land. The building and its contents account for 90 percent of the value of the facility; the remainder is attributed to the land itself. <br>What is the single loss expectancy of your shipping facility to avalanches?",

The EF is only the portion of the value lost due to the risk of avalanche, which is indicated as 90%. The 10% of the remaining value is assigned to the land, which is required as the location for rebuilding (i.e., its value is not lost in this scenario). (A) $3 million is the overall value of the facility, contents, and land combined. (D) $135,000 is the annualized loss expectancy (ALE), which is calculated by multiplying the SLE by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) of 5% per year. (C) The $270,000 is not a valid result of any standard quantitative risk analyses calculation based on the parameters of this scenario."

Option A is incorrect because network segmentation is not the issue since the network was already divided prior to the deployment of the new device. Option A is incorrect because a fail-open system will allow for open communications when a failure event occurs in order to protect availability. This situation does not indicate that the new device itself experienced a failure, just that end users are unable to access resources after its deployment. So, even if the firewall was a fail-open system, it did not experience a failure and did not revert to its open-upon-fault state. Option D is incorrect because the issue of whether the new product is a closed or open system is not the cause of the communication problems.

Some containerization solutions allow for multiple concurrent applications withing a single container, whereas others are limited to one per container. Many containerization solutions allow for customization of how much interaction applications in separate containers is allowed. The other options are incorrect. A virtual machine–based system uses a hypervisor installed onto the bare metal of the host server and then operates a full guest OS within each virtual machine, and each virtual machine often supports only a single primary application. Software-defined visibility (SDV) is a framework to automate the processes of network monitoring and response."

The isolation principle states that two transactions operating on the same data must be temporarily separated from each other such that one does not interfere with the other.  The consistency principle says that the database must always be in a state that complies with the database model's rules.  The durability principle says that transactions committed to the database must be preserved.  Together, these four principles are known as the ACID model."

A third party typically keeps the original data along with the token, so the original data can still be used."

If Colin had attempted sending the files as email attachments (assuming they were sent via the company network and/or company email server), then the DLP and firewall systems would have detected this attempt of data exfiltration. It is unlikely that a recently hired product tester would have been granted access to the company's cloud backup service. But if so, there would still be the need to transfer the files to an external entity and there is no record of that, so accessing the backup alone is not enough of an explanation. Replacing the OS on a mobile device might have removed any local security mechanisms that could have blocked or detected the confidential file transfer.

(D) A dissolvable NAC agent can be set to run once and then terminate. (E) An agentless NAC performs port scans, service queries, and vulnerability scans against networked systems to determine whether devices are authorized and baseline compliant. The other statements are incorrect. The correct version of these statements would be: (C) An agentless NAC is unable to automatically quarantine and resolve security issues on hosts. An agentless system requires an administrator to manually resolve any discovered issues. (F) IEEE 802.1X can be used by a NAC solution as a means to grant or deny network access based on authentication, but NAC does not require the use of IEEE 802.1X."

VMS is a software solution that assists with the management and procurement of staffing services, hardware, software, and other needed products and services.

The other three options do not apply to this scenario since they are not a means to view, manage, or optimize the relationship between an organization and third-party suppliers. Security information and event management (SIEM) can be used to aggregate data sources, such as log files, perform real-time network traffic capture, and perform data analytics to provide near-real-time alerts and reports on security issues and incidents. A service-level requirement (SLR) is a statement of the expectations of service and performance from the product or service of a vendor. This is the wrong tool in this scenario since existing vendor services need to be managed and a new relationship with another vendor is not being established. A business partners agreement (BPA) is a contract between two entities dictating the terms of their business relationship. It clearly defines the expectations and obligations of each partner in the endeavor.

Most likely the VoIP service used for the call last month was using plaintext RTP. Note that VoIP recording can still occur at the endpoints even if SRTP or other communication encryption is in use. Multimedia collaboration is not likely to be a security improvement over the existing solution. Adding other features, such as video and whiteboard sharing, would not address the problem. Direct inward system access (DISA) is a security solution for PBX, not VoIP. Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is a DNS- based email authentication system, not a VoIP security solution."

A rootkit is usually deposited on a system as a file that is then executed upon system load or application launch. Cryptomalware installs a cryptominer on a victim system. Spyware collects information about the system user."

It is not a means to resolve the coding deadline issue in this scenario, but is a source of guidance of crafting more secure code of Web, IoT, and mobile applications. Normalization is a programming and management technique used to reduce redundancy, often related to database management. This is not a useful mechanism in this scenario. A stored procedure is a subroutine or software module that can be called on or accessed by applications interacting with a relational database management system (RDBMS). Stored procedures may be used for data validation during input, managing access control, assessing the logic of data, and more. Stored procedures can make some database applications more efficient, consistent, and secure. Stored procedures are an allow lists of existing software functions where users or other applications are limited to the pre-determined range of functions.

The ARO = 6/year (3 times in six months is 6 times per year). Thus, ALE1 = SLE * ARO = $30,000,000. The post-countermeasure ARO=1/year, so the ALE2 is = $5,000,000.

An endpoint device could be a user's workstation, a tablet, a smartphone, an IoT device, an ICS system, an edge computing sensor, and any public-facing servers in a screened subnet or extranet. Being able to control, much less trust, all of these devices has caused the loss of a clearly defined security perimeter between the outside untrusted world and the inside trusted organization. This results in the \"assume breach\" stance, which requires organizations to \"never trust, always verify.\" The other options are incorrect. Option A, advanced persistent threats (APTs), are a serious security concern, but they are primarily external entities attacking from foreign lands, so they are not the primary cause of the switch to the zero trust model. Option C, poor authentication technologies, are primarily an issue of choice; there are reliable and robust authentication options available, such as mutual certificate authentication and multi-factor authentication. Poor authentication is not the primary reason to adopt zero trust, since zero trust requires reliable authentication to be effective. Option D, micro-segmentation, is not a reason to adopt the zero trust model, but it is a core element of implementing the zero trust model."

Static packet-filtering firewalls are stateless and do not consider context of the communications. Application-level firewalls operate at the Application layer (layer 7) and therefore do not evaluate source and destination address; however, they may perform stateful inspection of the packet payload specific to the Application-layer protocol it is focused on (such as HTTP for a WAF). Circuit-level firewalls are able to make permit and deny decisions in regard to circuit establishment either based on simple rules for IP and port, using captive portals, requiring port authentication via 802.1X, or more complex elements such as context- or attribute-based access control."

Automation is the control of systems on a regular scheduled, periodic, or triggered basis that does not require manual hands-on interaction. Automation is often critical to a resilient security infrastructure. (A) A script can be configured to execute based on a triggering event. (B) Automation of vulnerability scans can ensure the evaluation is performed without relying upon a human to remember to perform the scan. (D) A script can be set to run code based on date and time. (E) Fuzzing tests can be automated to run a various time intervals. (G) Code scanners can be configured to run on a schedule. (H) Blocking communications based on invalid content is an automated filtering process. Automation and scripting are not useful in relation to (C) crafting new code, nor (F) approving software to be deployed into production.

This is to ensure that only the actual final, tested, and approved version of files is released and that those files were not corrupted or infected with malware prior to distribution. The size of the code is not as relevant as the hashes, although a change in the size of code would result in a change in the hash value. Activating rollback is only performed if a deployment goes bad and systems need to be restored back to their pre-rollout state. System images do not need to be rolled out or installed prior to installing or distributing new software. Doing so would likely result in lost data, customizations, and configurations performed on those system since the previous system image update."

A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is used to protect the confidential information within an organization from being disclosed by a current or former employee.

      "explanation": "Locard's principle is most relevant to Rob's forensic investigation for trace digital evidence, as it suggests that any contact between two objects results in an exchange of materials. In the context of digital forensics, this principle implies that there is always some form of digital trace or residue left behind when devices interact or when data is transferred. \nKerckhoff's principle states that a system's security should not depend on the secrecy of its algorithm but rather on the secrecy of its keys. The principle of least privilege is a security concept in which a user is given the minimum levels of access—or permissions—needed to perform his job functions. Lastly, the defense-in-depth principle is a layered security approach that establishes multiple levels of defense to protect information. While these other three principles are important in cybersecurity, they do not directly relate to the collection and analysis of digital trace evidence like Locard's principle does."
