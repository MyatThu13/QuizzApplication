Options A and C are explicitly defined by exact numbers and are just the sort of aspects that belong in the Service level agreement (SLA). Option D, the amount of time allowed to transition between normal and contingency operations, is also an explicit numerical value, but it is not a recurring event, regularly anticipated during each period of performance (or shouldn't be, anyway; if your cloud provider is fluctuating between normal and contingency ops every performance period, you should probably find a new provider), so this is something that can be defined once in the contract, and if the provider fails to perform in the (hopefully rare) event it needs to be evaluated, then the provider is in breach, and there should be remedies available other than the Service level agreement (SLA).

IaaS is a less attractive option because it would retain the need for Alice’s company to administer the OSs in addition to building their software; it might be less expensive in terms of paying the cloud provider, but the time and effort and personnel necessary to maintain the OSs would offset that cost, probably in a net-negative way.

Metered service doesn’t pose much of a security risk. The SLA might include some security aspects (such as response time), but it’s usually more of a performance-ensuring tool, and this choice is not as good as option A. Remote access, in this particular case, provides more benefit than risk: Alice can utilize work from developers located across the country or across the planet. While she does have to consider the risks inherent in all remote access, those risks are not as significant as the risks due to multitenancy, so option A is still preferable."

Egress monitoring (often referred to as “DLP” solutions) is a great way to reduce the likelihood of intellectual property leaving the owner’s control in an unexpected/unapproved manner. Likewise, strong encryption is useful in the cloud to reduce the impact of theft either from leakage to other cloud tenants or from insider threats (such as malicious admins in the employ of the cloud provider). Finally, digital watermarks aid protection of intellectual property by proving original ownership, which is essential for enforcing intellectual property rights (in the case of software design, mainly copyright protections)."

But even that aspect is contingent on the users accessing cloud resources remotely, so option C is still a better answer than A. <br>The metered service nature of cloud computing has nothing to do with a hijacking threat; metered service indicates that the customer pays only for those resources users consume. <br>Cloud customers pool resources might be of concern when considering hijacking attacks because poorly configured cloud environments could leave one cloud customer subject to attack by another tenant in that same environment.

You want your BC/DR plan/process to include sufficient detail such that it could be followed by someone with the right background (perhaps IT for certain roles, security for others, etc.) but without any experience or specific training in that role. This is because a contingency of the scope that would require initiation of BC/DR activities might involve dramatic, significant external forces to the point where the personnel normally tasked with BC/DR actions are not available (for instance, natural disasters, fire, civil disruption, etc.), so the tasks may need to be completed by whoever is available at the time. <br>The BC/DR plan/process should be written and documented in such a way that someone with the requisite skills can use it. It is unlikely that typical users or regulators have the requisite skills to perform many of the BC/DR activities. Therefore options A and C are poor choices for answers to the question. <br>It is tempting to choose option B, however, option D is a better answer because it ensures that someone with the requisite skills will be able to read the BC/DR plan and perform the activities they document. Having to rely on essential BC/DR team members being present and available to follow the plan is risky. So option B is incorrect."

Without clear-language support about the customer’s ownership of all intellectual property created in the cloud data center, the cloud provider could, ostensibly, make a claim on such property, as the provider’s resources were used in a collaborative effort to create that property. <br>Options B and D are security controls used to protect all sorts of assets, including intellectual property, but they are not as specifically addressing the creation of new intellectual property in the cloud the way explicit contract clauses would, so option C is still the better answer."

The warmer the climate in the location of the data center, the more energy it will take to exchange the heat, and the more costly the HVAC operation. This is the most significant factor. <br>Option A is incorrect and it is the only choice that does not affect energy costs; hot and cold aisle containment should be equivalent in terms of operational costs. <br>The initial cost of the HVAC units themselves will probably have an effect on operational costs because better equipment will cost more money, but it will also be more efficient and therefore less expensive to operate than cheaper alternatives. However, the effect still won’t be as significant as the external climate, so option C is still not as good as option B. <br>Good cable management will make airflow more efficient and therefore make HVAC less expensive, but this will not be as dramatic in impact on operating costs as the external environment.

For instance, fire poses a threat to health and human safety; obviating such risks should be a paramount concern to senior management. An insurance policy doesn’t truly protect people, it only offsets the damages people experience through loss. Also, the insurance policy would be a recurring, continual cost; it costs less than the fire suppression system in the <italic>first year</italic> of the plant’s operation ($12 million for insurance versus $15 million for the system), but once the system is purchased, though it may need upkeep and maintenance, we can assume it won’t cost the same amount in future years, and it probably won’t cost anywhere near as much as the continual costs of the insurance. <br>All the other options are not as good as B."

A game with security flaws is still a game and fulfills the purpose. Option A is therefore incorrect (although hotly debated among IT security personnel—remember, the game can exist without a security department, but the security department couldn’t exist without games). <br>Thus far, regulations have not imposed particular security conditions on delivered products by statute. This does not obviate all liability from shipping defective products, of course; the need for due care and due diligence remains. However, this is a much lower threshold than direct statutory guidance, which exists in fields other than software development (to date). Option C is incorrect. <br>Outsourcing may or may not be used when performing software security reviews; there is not enough information in the question to determine which method your company uses, so option D is too specific for the vague data provided."

      "explanation": "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is currently used to encrypt and protect U.S. government sensitive and secret data. There are variants, but the most common is 256-bit, which is virtually impossible to break today. <br>Option A is incorrect because MD5 is a cryptographic hash function used to verify that a file has not been altered. <br>SSL uses certificates to create a secure connection using encryption. Option B is incorrect. <br>Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher that has been replaced by AES encryption. The U.S. government uses AES and not Blowfish. Option C is incorrect."
