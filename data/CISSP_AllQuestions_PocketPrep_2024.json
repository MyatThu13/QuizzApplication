      "explanation": "<p>Correct answer: Time of Check/Time of Use attack</p><p>The TOC/TOU (Time-of-Check/Time-of-Use) attack is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a system's behavior is based on the status or conditions at two different points in time. This time gap between the check (TOC) and the use (TOU) allows an attacker to manipulate the system between the time of checking the status and the time of using it, leading to potential security issues.</p><p>The attack generally follows these steps:</p><ol><li>Time of Check (TOC): At a specific point in time, the system checks a condition or state to determine whether the user or process is authorized to perform a particular action or access a resource.</li><li>Time of Use (TOU): After the check, there is a time gap before the system actually uses the result of the check to grant access or perform the action.</li><li>Exploitation: An attacker takes advantage of this time gap by changing the system's state or conditions between the TOC and the TOU. They may modify permissions, resources, or data to gain unauthorized access or perform actions that they should not be allowed to execute.</li></ol><p>A fuzzing attack, also known as fuzz testing or fuzzing, is a software testing technique used to discover vulnerabilities, bugs, or weaknesses in a computer program or system by subjecting it to a large number of random, invalid, or unexpected inputs. The goal of fuzzing is to identify potential points of failure and security flaws that may not have been detected through traditional testing methods. A buffer overflow attack attempts to overflow a process's memory boundary, causing it to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This will cause a program or operating system to either crash or execute the arbitrary code that the attack added that overflowed into the next memory space. Command injection attacks occur when the attacker is able to insert an operating system command into a user interface, for example, command.exe.</p>"

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of protocols. This is a method of protecting data in transmission.

This typically includes enrollment/registration (collecting username and other data about the user), proofing (verifying the identity of the user via photo ID and other means), and establishing the user\u2019s identity by creating required accounts and assigning necessary privileges. Provisioning also may include issuing devices and having users sign off on necessary corporate policies.</li><li><strong>Deprovisioning:</strong> Deprovisioning is the process of offboarding employees and revoking their access to corporate systems. An organization may choose to delete user accounts or simply lock them to ensure that useful data is preserved. It should also collect any company-owned devices from the former employee.</li><li><strong>Role Definition and Transition:</strong> As employees grow and the company changes, new roles may need to be created or assigned. For example, an employee promoted to management will need new access granted to them and some privileges removed. The company may also need to create or update roles to support new types of employees or corporate systems.</li><li><strong>Account Maintenance:</strong> Account maintenance involves reviewing and updating rights and privileges to ensure that they are aligned with a user\u2019s current needs.</li><li><strong>Account Access Review:</strong> Administrators should regularly review accounts to ensure that they have appropriate privileges and are not inactive. Privilege-related issues include excessive privileges (like unneeded administrator-level access) and privilege creep (acquiring and retaining unneeded privileges as job roles change).</li><li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Privilege escalation involves moving to a higher privilege level via the use of sudo or similar means. This privilege escalation should only occur when needed and be logged.</li><li><strong>Service Accounts Management:</strong> Service accounts are used by applications instead of users. They need certain levels of access, which should be tailored to their role rather than using over-privileged built-in accounts.</li></ol>"

The authentication types that it can carry include smartcards, tokens, and biometrics, as well as the traditional password.</p><p>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is one of the oldest authentication protocols that transports a password and only a password. Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) was the next protocol after PAP, but it also only carries passwords. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is when a second type of authentication is added. Type 1 is something you know, e.g. passwords. Type 2 is something you have, e.g. smart cards. Type 3 is something you are, e.g. fingerprints. It is not a protocol, it is the idea that the user is required to use two of those types to successfully authenticate. EAP can carry all of these types of authentication methods.</p>"

It uses the following steps:</p><ol><li>The client listens to the LAN media to determine if it's in use</li><li>If the media is clear, the client sends the transmission</li><li>While transmitting, the client listens for collisions</li><li>If a collision is detected, the client sends a jam signal</li><li>If a jam signal is received, all hosts stop transmitting and wait a random backoff time before starting over again at step 1</li></ol><p>CSMA/CA is used in wireless networks. Collisions are avoided by having the host/wireless device select a random number and then transmit after counting to that number. This reduces the chance that two devices will transmit at the same time, thereby having the frames collide. Token passing is used by the token ring technology (IEEE 802.5). Collisions are avoided because there is a single token on the ring and a device/host cannot transmit unless it is in possession of that token. Spread spectrum is a wireless technology and is a method of modulating the signals transmitted.</p>"

There are three factors that can be used to prove identity, they are something you know (factor 1), something you have (factor 2), and something you are (factor 3). Authorization is the granting of permissions such as read, write, full control, tag, or list. Accountability is the logging of the activities that have occurred, for example, mistyped passwords or logging in. It allows the corporation to hold the user accountable for the actions they take.</p>"

During the mandatory vacation, the employees' work is audited.</p><p>Separation of duties is a control used to prevent fraud because it limits the ability of a user to complete a transaction or task on their own. For example, if an employee is trying to receive money in response to a fake invoice, the employee should only be able to perform part of the work, as accounts receivable should verify the work was done. Or they can perform the accounts payable, which should also confirm the work was done, or that the goods were received (whatever the 'fake' invoice was for).</p><p>Split knowledge is the concept that a critical piece of information, e.g., a combination for a safe, or the password for a critical private key, is split into at least two pieces and given to that number of people.

The SIEM then correlates the logs from the many sources within the network to 'connect the dots' and determine if there has been a likely compromise. This generates the Indication of Compromise (IoC). Using a SIEM, an administrator can create reports that show access history and are useful for security personnel to verify physical or logical access. A SIEM can be configured to generate alerts if certain logs or patterns are observed.</p><p>If knowledge of the number of user credentials that do not match the corporate policy is needed, a vulnerability assessment should be performed.

This caused the same IV to be used multiple times throughout the stream, allowing attackers to find patterns between messages using the same IV.</p><p>The IV does not change the key length in any way. The purpose is to solely hide patterns found within the plaintext so that they are not exposed in the ciphertext. Diffusion occurs when there is enough change from plaintext to ciphertext. If one bit of the plaintext is changed there needs to be a significant change to the ciphertext. If not, there is too much predictability in the algorithm. Collision is a term related to hashing algorithms. If two pieces of plaintext hashes to the same value, there is a collision. This is the problem that the birthday attack exploits.

When a biometric device is too sensitive, type 1 errors (false negatives) are more common. When a biometric device is not sensitive enough, type 2 errors (false positives) are more common. The best scenario is a low CER. This means that the device very rarely has a false acceptance or a false rejection.</p><p>Logging is done when someone does use the biometric system. It would record if someone is granted access or not. It is essential to log what happens so that when things break or there is a breach or something else of that sort, it is possible to sort out what happened. This is not critical for success but this is critical when there is a failure. The storage capacity of a biometric system is usually not an issue.

TPMs are frequently utilized for full-disk encryption to ensure data at rest is encrypted. Microsoft\u2019s BitLocker leverages a TPM chip to encrypt data written to the disk.</p><p>TPMs are not used to authenticate components of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). The TCB is a concept that addresses the totality of the components that make up a secure and trusted system. The TPM could be one of those components. Integrity threats within frames are called Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC). CRCs are similar to hash functions.</p><p>Isolating threads would be a function of the operating system. It is the practice of isolating threads or execution units within a process to prevent them from interfering with each other's data or state. Isolation can be achieved through various mechanisms including locks, semaphores, and memory barriers. This is crucial to maintain the stability and correctness of concurrent software, as it prevents issues like data races and ensures the predictable behavior of threads within a program.</p>"

For example, an IT manager may have attributes granting them access to IT resources and management-level resources.</li><li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</strong> MAC assigns classification labels to subjects and objects to govern access. An example of MAC is the system used by some governments, which includes classifications such as Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret, with compartments within each level.</li><li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</strong> DAC allows the owner of an asset to manage access to that asset via an ACL. This is the default access control model used by most operating systems.</li><li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> RBAC defines groups based on various roles and assigns privileges to these groups. Users are assigned to a group and inherit the privileges associated with it. Group Policies in Windows use RBAC. RBAC is good for protecting against privilege creep, because removing a user from a group removes all the associated permissions.</li><li><strong>Rule-Based Access Control:</strong> Rule-based access controls define rules that govern access to a system. Firewalls are an example of a system that uses rule-based access control to manage traffic flowing through it.</li><li><strong>Risk-Based Access Control:</strong> Risk-based access control assesses the risk posed by a request before granting or denying it. For example, some resources may only be accessible from on-prem networks or trusted devices.</li></ul>"

MAC ensures that access rights are determined and set by system administrators or security policies, rather than by individual users or processes. This makes it particularly useful in high-security environments, such as government agencies, military organizations, and critical infrastructure systems.

In a DAC system, resource owners have the authority to determine who can access their resources and what level of access those users are granted.</p><p>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an access control mechanism used in computer systems and databases to manage and enforce access rights based on users' roles and responsibilities within an organization. In RBAC, access permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users, making it easier to manage and enforce access control in large and complex environments.</p><p>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an advanced access control mechanism that uses a set of attributes and policies to make access control decisions. In ABAC, access permissions are determined based on the attributes associated with users, resources, and environmental conditions.

If a user does not need read access to data to carry out their job role, they should not be granted access. The need-to-know principle differs from least privilege because the need-to-know principle is only concerned with read access.</p><p>If a user has an NTK then the question is what level of permission do they need. Do they need read, write, full control, or another level? The best idea is to give them as little permission as possible, just enough to do their job. This is called the principle of least privilege.</p><p>Split knowledge is a tool to control very sensitive data or systems. The information is literally split among two or more people. It is necessary for all of them to be there to be able to complete the job, whatever it is. For example, if there is a Hardware Security Module (HSM) that contains all of the keys that are used to encrypt the corporation's data, it would be a good idea to split the password/key into many pieces and give each piece to a different person. In order for the password/key to be entered to access the keys in the HSM, all of the people who have a piece of the password/key in their possession must be present to get access to the keys in the HSM.</p><p>Kerchoff\u2019s principle is one of the six that Augusta Kerchoff wrote about in the late 1800s. The principle that the industry is still struggling with is that the secrecy of the algorithm is not what should be used to protect our data, rather the secrecy of the key is what must be maintained. The algorithm should actually be published and analyzed by many people to ensure that the math of the algorithm is as strong as possible.</p>"

This ensures the security of the source code from being released to the public while allowing a way for software to be relied upon or passed on to someone else when the creator is no longer available.</p><p>Code repositories are similar, but are more concerned with holding code in an air-gapped network for the purposes of protection. Code repositories aren't directly concerned with passing on code or providing it in escrow in the event the creator goes out of business. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) involve analyzing code in real-time or statically. For example, you can manually inspect code through SAST or use DAST to test code as it runs in real-time. Fagan inspections and malware analysis are prime examples of both processes being used.

There are temperature-based fire detection systems. They work on the basis that once the environment reaches a certain temperature, the fire suppression system releases its suppression agent. There is no temperature suppression system though. However, water works by reducing the temperature of a fire. Water can be used on class A fires.</p>"

Tokenization refers to the technique of mapping sensitive data elements to, and replacing them with, an identifying token that is not itself sensitive if revealed.

It is a chip that is resident on the motherboard of a computer.</p><p>Modern cryptography can be divided into three types of algorithms: symmetric&nbsp;encryption algorithms, asymmetric&nbsp;encryption algorithms, and hashing algorithms. Symmetric encryption is the oldest and most well-known technique. A secret key, which can be a number, a word, or just a string of random letters, is applied to the text of a message to change the content in a particular way. This might be as simple as shifting each letter by a number of places in the alphabet. As long as both sender and recipient know the secret key, they can encrypt and decrypt all messages that use this key. The main disadvantage of symmetric key encryption is that all parties involved have to exchange the key used to encrypt the data before they can decrypt it.</p><p>Asymmetric encryption&nbsp;includes two related keys or a key pair. A public key is made freely available to anyone who might want to send you a message. A second, private key is kept secret so that only you know it. Any messages (text, binary files, or documents) that are encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted by applying the same algorithm, but by using the matching private key. Any message that is encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted by using the matching public key.</p><p>Hashing is a method of cryptography that converts any form of data into a unique string of text. Any piece of data can be hashed, no matter its size or type. In traditional hashing, regardless of the data\u2019s size, type, or length, the hash that any data produces is always the same length. A hash is designed to act as a one-way function\u200a, you can put data into a hashing algorithm and get a unique string, but if you come upon a new hash, you cannot decipher the input data it represents. A unique piece of data will always produce the same hash. Hashing is a mathematical operation that is easy to perform, but extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.</p>"

That means that the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. Since the company is using a public cloud provider, it can be assumed that it is a different company. When personal data is stored or processed by another corporation, it is considered a data processor. The data processor acts on behalf of the company. GDPR also defines \u2018processing\u2019 to include the storage of data. So, even if the cloud provider never accesses, touches, or uses that personal data, they are still considered a data processor. GDPR defines a data processor as \u2018a person who processes data solely on behalf of the controller, excluding the employees of the data&nbsp;controller.\u2019</p><p>The data controller is a role found within a business. The controller is defined by GDPR as \u2018a person who alone or jointly with others processes or controls or authorizes the processing of&nbsp;data.\u2019 Data owners and custodians are not defined within GDPR. These are terms that have been used in information security for decades. A data owner is not a business owner. It is a specific role that has a relationship with a piece of data. An owner is responsible for a piece or a set of data. For example, a spreadsheet or a database. The data custodian implements data policies, performs regular backups, manages access controls, and ensures compliance with corporate policies, baseline, and so on.</p><p>Data owners work closely with data custodians who handle the technical aspects of data management to ensure that the data is used effectively, responsibly, and securely to support business objectives.</p>"

Critical servers are often placed behind load balancers that use health checks, also known as heartbeats, to verify the servers are still functioning correctly. If the load balancer detects a fault, it will redirect traffic to a different server in the cluster or farm.

To ultimately prevent this from happening, the proprietary information should not have been stored on or accessible from the same network employees operate on for normal activities. Additionally, the information should have been encrypted to prevent it from even being readable by outsiders. This is a prime example of how proper asset handling and management can go a long way.

The prudent person is someone with a similar level of knowledge who, in the same situation, would have taken or not taken the same actions.

In this instance, full knowledge testing may also involve credentialed scans or even being given a complete topology of the network.</p><p>Partial knowledge testing includes providing some information to a penetration tester. Partial knowledge emulates an attack coming from someone such as a customer, contractor, vendor, or employee who has some knowledge of the business before the attack.</p><p>Zero knowledge testing typically involves penetration testers acting in the position of an attacker. In this instance, penetration testers aren't given information beforehand and must conduct their test from the point of view of an actual attacker. While it may be the most realistic testing approach, it does open the door to vulnerabilities being hidden from the company if the penetration tester doesn't find them. In turn, this could lead to trouble if a legitimate attacker exploits that vulnerability.</p><p>Insider threats are usually employees who are either upset with the organization or are accidentally malicious due to a lack of knowledge.

It is not a question of what level of access (read, write, etc.) it is a question of do they need that data in any way. The permissions are addressed in least privilege. Separation of duties is the idea that a job is broken into tasks and then some of the tasks are assigned to one person and the rest of the tasks are assigned to a second person. There could be more people involved, but it must involve at least two people to be able to complete a task. For example, if someone can add an invoice to the accounts receivables, they should not also be able to process the payment. That task should be assigned to someone else, an accounts payable clerk perhaps so that they can verify that it is a real customer, real products/services, and that then they can send a payment to them.

Both common law and civilist law are broken down into three primary subcategories.&nbsp;</p><p>The first subcategory is criminal law. This includes laws that make physically harming another illegal (e.g. assault and battery laws). The second subcategory is where you find lawsuits. Tort law is a good name to use here. In the US, it is commonly called civil law which causes confusion with a test like CISSP. The third subcategory is administrative (or regulatory) laws. These are laws that are intended to protect the population from corporations. Health Information Protection and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US is a good example here.</p><p>Religious laws are legal systems that are based on what the religion considers correct behavior. In the Middle East, Sharia law (Muslim law) is an example. Vatican City is another location where religious law is found.

The conversion of certain characters within form inputs (e.g. ') into their HTML character entity reference equivalents (e.g. &amp;apos) prior to processing is an example of output encoding. Cross-site scripting and request forgery are both types of web application attacks that can result from weak input validation and/or output encoding.</p>"

This principle bids developers to consider the security implications of exceptions (errors) in their code and incorporate error handling routines that manage them to preserve the security of the application (and the data accessible through it). The concept of a fail secure begins with the definition of a secure state. This idea was introduced by David Bell and Leonard LaPadula in 1976. The secure state is basically the definition of how a corporation wants something to behave and that includes through failure. The technical options are to fail open or fail closed. If the system fails as desired, it will fail securely. This is defined in the orange book as well as ISO 15408.</p><p>Trust but verify is a secure design principle that challenges assumptions of trust derived from certain criteria without trust being explicitly verified (e.g. traffic originating from an internal network). Separation of duties is a secure design principle that demands a sensitive task be split between two or more individuals to reduce the risk of fraud, abuse, or errors. Shared responsibility is a secure design principle that recognizes that security can only be maintained through collective efforts (i.e. security is everyone's responsibility).</p>"

If the backups sit for years without being tested, it may not be known whether the drivers need to be updated in the production environment or whether a data custodian should move those backups to different drives. If all data that has not been backed up yet is run through the backup process, that would be a good thing. However, the same issues arise as initially backing the data up if it is never tested. The backup process is not complete until it is tested for restorability. Creating a hash of data is important for integrity's sake, but it doesn't ensure that data will be easily integrated into the production environment when needed. For this reason, it's always important to remember the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad when dealing with data.

Risk is the likelihood, or chance of a threat being realized and the impact it would have on that system/business.

For example the theft of a laptop.</p><p>A safeguard is defined in two ways. One school of thought says that safeguards, countermeasures, and controls are all the same thing. So, a safeguard is a control that is added to reduce the likelihood and/or the impact of a potential threat. The second school of thought defines safeguards and countermeasures as two different types of controls: safeguards as preventive in nature and countermeasures as reactive in nature. For example, a cable lock on a laptop has the intention of preventing the theft of the laptop (emphasis on intention). In the event the laptop is stolen, Mobile Device Management (MDM) could be used to locate the device or send a command to overwrite the existing data on the drive in that laptop.</p>"

For example, someone who is unfamiliar with the systems will take longer to conduct an audit. Additionally, they may require additional resources that an internal employee wouldn't need, which may include having someone show them around the building or familiarizing the auditor with the structure of networks.</p><p>Since a third party has no vested interest in the company they're auditing, it's fair to say the auditor would be impartial during the audit. With that said, they would have less of a reason to not be transparent with whoever they may be auditing. Third-party auditors are just as qualified as anyone to audit, so again, there is no reason not to trust their practices or the accuracy of results. After all, they may be conducting the audit on behalf of a major auditor. Logically, conflicts of interest would be vetted to avoid any of the aforementioned worries.</p>"

It documents who had control of evidence at any given point to ensure that it is admissible during trial. It also documents what was done with the evidence, where it was, how it was treated, how it was moved from location to location, and when it was handled.</p><p>Electronic discovery, or E-discovery, is the process of identifying, collecting, and analyzing Electronically Stored Information (ESI) for legal purposes. It is used in legal investigations, litigation, and compliance. Electronic review involves the examination and analysis of ESI during the e-discovery process, typically for legal purposes, compliance, or investigation. Custody documentation would be for the chain of custody. Chain of custody is a documented, unbroken trail of evidence custody, detailing its collection, transfer, storage, and analysis. It ensures the integrity and admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings, particularly in forensic and investigative contexts. Documentation is just a part of the chain of custody. The question only addresses that there is documentation. Chain of custody is the bigger concept that must be able to document when, where, why, who, and what regarding the evidence. The critical element of the chain of custody is the ability to prove that the evidence was never left unattended. If there is a gap in the chain that documents when and where the evidence is, the possibility of it having been tampered with exists. That is not acceptable for evidence in a court case.</p>"

They determine which packets are allowed or denied based on criteria like source or destination IP, port, and protocol. ACLs serve as a barrier between networks, filtering traffic to enhance security. Properly configured ACLs prevent unauthorized access and limit potential attack vectors, safeguarding network resources and data.

The CA public key is the key that a device would use to validate Joe\u2019s public key (in the question). The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is built as a hierarchy of CAs.

A template for developing the BIA is provided to assist the user.</li><li><strong>Identify preventive controls.</strong> Measures taken to reduce the effects of system disruptions can increase system availability and reduce contingency life cycle costs.</li><li><strong>Create contingency strategies.</strong> Thorough recovery strategies ensure that the system may be recovered quickly and effectively following a disruption.</li><li><strong>Develop an information system contingency plan.</strong> The contingency plan should contain detailed guidance and procedures for restoring a damaged system unique to the system's security impact level and recovery requirements.</li><li><strong>Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises.</strong> Testing validates recovery capabilities, whereas training prepares recovery personnel for plan activation, and exercising the plan identifies planning gaps; combined, the activities improve plan effectiveness and overall organization preparedness.</li><li><strong>Ensure plan maintenance.</strong> The plan should be a living document that is updated regularly to remain current with system enhancements and organizational changes.</li></ol><p>Budgeting is always a critical topic as everything in information and cyber security costs money. A postmortem is performed after something like an incident response, disaster recovery event, or business continuity event. It occurs after actions have been taken to recover from some kind of incident. It is also known as an after-action report or a variety of other names. It is the result of the meeting where the actions taken are discussed and assessed. Threat modeling is basically a risk assessment. Arguably this is a step in business continuity planning, but it is usually referred to as a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), as stated above in step two.</p>"

PGP uses a web of trust instead of a traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The commercial version uses the asymmetric algorithms of RSA and the free version uses the Diffie-Hellman&nbsp;key exchange. Symmetric algorithms are used to encrypt and protect the confidentiality of data.</p><p>Asymmetric algorithms should be used for symmetric key exchange or to digitally sign the data, but not for confidentiality as it is too slow. Asymmetric algorithms can be 1,000 to 10,000 times slower than symmetric algorithms when they are encrypting and decrypting data. The hashing algorithm used by PGP is the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) 1. SHA1 is used to verify the integrity of the data, not to encrypt the data. Hashing is a one-way function that can only be used to verify the data. It works by taking the data and running it through a calculation that can be verified on the receiving side of the transmission. Hashing algorithms such as SHA1 are clearly defined and can be performed by anyone; there is no key used in the process. Encryption has a secret key that is used to keep the data, in an encrypted format, from being decryptable by anyone other than the intended recipient.&nbsp;</p><p>A redundant scheme is not applicable here as it is not an encryption answer in any way.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>Correct answer: Fail-closed</p><p>The fail-closed failure state puts the system into a high level of security and disables it entirely or shuts it down until an administrator has the chance to diagnose the issue and restore the device to regular operation. This prevents attackers from causing the system to fail and gaining access afterward. An example of fail-closed would be if a network switch blocked all devices from authenticating if the authentication server became unavailable. If the network switch allowed devices to connect even if the authentication server was offline, it would be classified as fail-open.</p><p>Once the failure state is defined and put into the policy and supporting documents, this answer can change from fail-closed to fail-secure. Failing secure is failing according to policy. This is how the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) (a.k.a the Orange Book) as well as the International Standards Organization (ISO) 15408 define fail secure. This is also supported by the Bell-LaPadula security model. They define the \u2018secure state\u2019 as the one defined within the policy of the business. Since the question does not mention anything about the corporation's needs or policy, fail-closed is a better answer.</p><p>Mistaking fail-closed as being the same as fail-secure is a common mistake.</p><p>Fail-open is when a system allows all traffic to pass as mentioned in the second paragraph above. The initial reaction by security personnel is to not link fail-open and fail-secure together but that is a mistake. If the company demands that when there is a failure the system allows traffic to pass, then this too could be considered fail-secure. Consider the scenario above regarding the network switch. If that switch was in a hospital then failing into a closed state would block doctors from accessing patient records and it could actually become a life-threatening situation. The hospital could state that open is the preferred state, therefore, it would make fail-open a fail secure-state.</p><p>Fail-safe is the state that protects life safety.</p>"

Cryptography is used for authentication and non-repudiation through digital signatures, digital certificates, and/or Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). To repudiate means&nbsp;that it is possible to deny an action or activity. Non-repudiation means that an action&nbsp;or occurrence cannot be easily denied so a user can be held accountable for their actions. This means if a service cannot be confirmed, it is not at a non-repudiation status and it can actually be denied or repudiated.</p><p>Cryptanalysis is the attacking of cryptography. If there is a reliable approach to attacking cryptography that means it was not done properly. If the encryption was a digital signature, and there was a reliable way to attack it, that would prevent the proof of source. That is, again, the opposite of non-repudiation. A reproduced signature is simply a signature that can be recreated. This assumes two things, one, the original data, and two, the private key are in the hands of someone. The answer does not indicate who is in possession of the private key. If it is the correct person then non-repudiation is provable, if it is not the right party then there is repudiation.

This allows the attacker to manipulate an application or operating system into performing actions that would normally not be possible. For example, assume process A authorizes a user to open a non-critical file, and process B opens the file. Suppose the attacker replaces the non-critical file with a protected file before process A finishes executing. When process B runs the open command, it will open the protected file instead of the non-critical file.</p><p>Buffer overflow attacks occur when input validation is not performed. If more data is received than expected, it will write to the proper buffer space and then overflow into the next. When this occurs, either an application/operating system will crash or it will execute arbitrary data.</p><p>A birthday attack is done against a hashing algorithm. If all of the data in this explanation area was hashed it would hash to a particular digest value. An attack is looking for another set of data that hashes to the same value. This attack is performed against passwords normally. If successful, the attacker does not need to figure out the correct password, they only have to find a password value that hashes to the same value to gain access to that account. Salting the hash helps prevent this by adding a random number to the password before hashing.</p><p>There are many attacks that fit into the category of client-side manipulation. One of the most commonly recognized and known is Cross Site Scripting (CSS or XSS). XSS occurs when an HTML code on a webpage is altered.

It provides monitoring for connections to servers or security systems. For instance, if the door lock cable is cut, the test signal will fail, and personnel will be alerted to the issue. Heartbeat sensors are also used to trigger High Availability (HA) events on servers or network equipment.

This level of access is necessary for managing hardware devices, setting up memory protection, and handling interrupts.</li><li>Critical System Operations: The operating system's core functions, such as memory management, process scheduling, and input/output operations, require the ability to execute critical system instructions that are only permitted in kernel mode.</li><li>Exception Handling: When the CPU encounters exceptions, such as system calls, hardware interrupts, or page faults, the kernel mode provides the necessary privileges to handle these events effectively.</li><li>Memory Protection: The kernel mode enforces memory protection, ensuring that user-level processes cannot access restricted memory areas or interfere with the operating system's critical data structures.</li><li>Privileged Instructions: Certain CPU instructions are considered privileged, meaning they can only be executed in kernel mode. These instructions are essential for controlling system-level operations and managing hardware resources.</li></ol><p>It is crucial to have a clear distinction between the kernel mode and the user mode to ensure the security and stability of the operating system.

Software should be tested by developers as they are developing their code. For the formal step of testing software, it is essential to have it tested by people other than the ones who created it. There are many testing methodologies such as code walkthroughs that are performed by developers, just not the ones who wrote it. It is like trying to edit your own email. Seeing the typos and grammatical mistakes is very difficult because you know what you meant to say, even if that is not exactly what is on your screen.</p><p>Job rotation is a human resource strategy where employees periodically switch roles or departments within an organization. It aims to develop skills, reduce monotony, enhance adaptability, and promote a broader understanding of the company. Least privilege is a security principle where individuals or systems are only granted the minimum access permissions necessary to perform their tasks. It reduces the attack surface and minimizes risks. Mandatory vacations are a surprise vacation that allows the corporation to audit a user's work and is very commonly used in the finance world.</p>"

All objects have owners and access control is based on the discretion or decision of the owner. Most operating systems use DAC by default. The average OS allows the data owners to adjust file permissions themselves.</p><p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a security model and access control mechanism used in computer systems to enforce strict and centralized control over the access and manipulation of resources. MAC ensures that access rights are determined and set by system administrators or security policies, rather than by individual users or processes. This makes it particularly useful in high-security environments, such as government agencies, military organizations, and critical infrastructure systems. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an access control mechanism used in computer systems and databases to manage and enforce access rights based on users' roles and responsibilities within an organization. In RBAC, access permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users, making it easier to manage and enforce access control in large and complex environments. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an advanced access control mechanism that uses a set of attributes and policies to make access control decisions. In ABAC, access permissions are determined based on the attributes associated with users, resources, and environmental conditions. This approach provides more fine-grained and dynamic control over access compared to traditional access control models like RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and DAC (Discretionary Access Control).</p>"

Birthday attacks are used to find two passwords that hash to the same value. That way, a bad actor only has to find a password that hashes to the right value, not necessarily the right value. A rainbow table is a table of precomputed hashes for possible passwords.

If one knows that someone will be taking over their job functions soon, they are less likely to participate in fraudulent activities. If someone does do something fraudulent, job rotation increases the likelihood it will be discovered through a peer review when someone rotates into that job and is cross-trained on responsibilities. A peer review is performed, effectively, when someone rotates into a job. It is necessary to figure out where the last person left off in order to get to work. This peer review could either detect fraud or, knowing it will happen, reduce the likelihood of it ever happening.</p><p>It does not improve employee relationships. It potentially holds the potential of complicating those relationships when someone detects mistakes, or worse, malicious errors caused by a coworker. Split knowledge refers to dividing sensitive information among multiple parties to prevent unauthorized access, requiring collaboration for complete data comprehension.

Anycast addresses are primarily used for load balancing and redundancy purposes in distributed networks. Anycast addresses in IPv6 are represented using a specific address format. They use a prefix followed by a unique identifier, similar to other IPv6 addresses. However, unlike unicast or multicast addresses, anycast addresses are assigned to multiple devices or network interfaces. The main characteristic of anycast addresses is their ability to facilitate one-to-nearest communication. This means that when a packet is sent to an anycast address, it is routed to the nearest (topologically closest) device that holds that anycast address. This routing decision is typically based on routing protocols and network topology.</p><p>A broadcast address is a special type of address used in computer networks to send data packets to all devices within a specific network segment. It allows a single sender to reach multiple recipients simultaneously without knowing their individual addresses.</p><p>A unicast address is a type of network address used to send data packets to a specific device or computer within a network. It uniquely identifies a single destination for communication within the network.</p><p>Multicast is a network communication method where data packets are sent from one source to multiple destinations simultaneously. It optimizes bandwidth usage by delivering content to a specific group of recipients who have expressed interest in receiving the data.</p>"

If the switch does not know what interface the destination Media Access Control (MAC) address is connected to, it will send the frame out to all interfaces except the source interface. Once it learns the device's MAC address, it stores it in the forwarding table for future forwarding decisions.</p><p>If the forwarding table exceeds the allocated memory of the switch, it will begin to forward frames out of all interfaces. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating thousands of bogus MAC addresses that overflow the forwarding table. This allows the attacker to see unicast traffic between devices on a network.</p><p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning attacks happen when the attacker returns the wrong information when a device sends out an ARP request. This causes traffic to be sent to the wrong device, probably the threat actor, instead of the correct destination.</p><p>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) starvation attacks occur when the threat actor sends a flood of discovery packets to the DHCP server. That causes the DHCP server to allocate all of its IP addresses, making it impossible for legitimate users to acquire an address and join the network.</p><p>Synchronize (SYN) flood attacks occur when the threat actor does not move onto the 3rd step of the three-way handshake.

It is generally accepted that it requires the user to take some action, such as opening an attachment, for it to then spread to the next computer. However, they have been seen before and are known. Command injection occurs when the bad actor enters a command into the user interface, for example, command.exe, which then opens the command prompt to the bad actor.

IPsec protects the original IP packet by encrypting or hashing the IP packet and adding a new AH or ESP header with a new IP header. IPsec-specific protocols are:</p><ul><li>Authentication Header (AH) provides integrity of the packet and adds an AH header.</li><li>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides the confidentiality of the packet and adds an ESP header.</li><li>Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is used to negotiate tunnel parameters.</li></ul><p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to encrypt data in transmission, most commonly in web-based sessions. There is authentication at the beginning of the setup of the encrypted connection. It can even be mutual authentication. However, it is not an option in the question. The question says OR. In IPSec you can choose just Authentication Header (AH) and not enable ESP. The same is true with Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is used to encrypt the data transmission.

Mandatory vacations are similar to this but would remove one person from an environment temporarily to perform a proper audit of their work. In both instances, fellow employees would be able to potentially check the work of one another and the accurate completion of work. However, neither job rotations nor mandatory vacations would be a viable defense against the situation described in the question. An employee could make the data migration from a physical server to the cloud and potentially delete the logs from essentially anywhere, especially if the data servers are near a local workstation. Additionally, mandatory vacations would not be a solution, because the employee in question could complete half of the work now and the other half upon returning as logs can be deleted at any time. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is used to prevent the loss of data. Traditionally, it monitored outgoing data, such as emails, for data that should not be transmitted in a clear text email.

A brute-force attack rapidly applies a series of combinations to find a match. Increasing the size of a password exponentially increases the workload, and therefore, the time needed to successfully brute-force attack a password.</p><p>Changing the password frequently is incorrect because changing the password does not affect the speed or ease with which it can be cracked. It only helps once the password has been compromised by forcing the attacker to repeat the brute force attack.</p><p>Using a series of numbers in the password is incorrect because a strong password uses numbers and letters, and uppercase and lowercase in some combination. It is not necessary to have all four of those conditions together today. Strength is created by using some of those options and by making the password longer. Refer to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63, as well as other documents from other governments.</p><p>Using specific pronouns in the password is incorrect because pronouns have no bearing on a password's strength.</p>"

For example, if the value of the plaintext is \u2018hello\u2019 the ciphertext could be \u2018elhlo\u2019.

Access control systems come in many variations and can include Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).</p><p>DAC is a type of access control system that holds the business owner responsible for deciding which people are allowed in a specific location, physically or digitally. DAC is the least restrictive compared to the other systems, as it essentially allows an individual complete control over any objects they own, as well as the programs associated with those objects. A drawback is that it gives the end-user complete control in setting security level settings for other users and the permissions given to the end-user are inherited into other programs they use, which could potentially lead to malware being executed without the end-user being aware of it. MAC is commonly utilized in organizations that require an elevated emphasis on the confidentiality and classification of data (i.e. military). MAC doesn\u2019t permit owners to have a say in the entities having access to a unit or facility. Instead, only the owner and custodian have management of the access controls. MAC will typically classify all end-users and provide them with labels that permit them to gain access through security with established security guidelines. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an advanced access control model that focuses on granting or denying access to resources based on attributes associated with users, resources, and the environment. ABAC allows for fine-grained access control, where access decisions are based on a combination of attributes rather than simple roles or permissions. In ABAC, access control decisions are made using policies that define rules based on attributes. Attributes can include user attributes (e.g. role, department, clearance level), resource attributes (e.g. sensitivity level, type), and environmental attributes (e.g. time of day, location).</p>"

This meant that when a call was placed from a phone on the traditional network (that can be found in homes that have had a phone number for a very long time) a connection was built and established across the network. Once the path of that connection was established, the telephone call would use that path until the phone call ended. This process happens every time a phone call is established on that type of network.</p><p>Packet-switched networks include X.25, Frame Relay, Aysnchronous Transport Mode (ATM), and Multi-Protocol Label System (MPLS), for example. When data is sent across these networks, each packet takes its own path. This is also how ethernet networks operate. Data packets can, therefore, arrive out of order. If the packets (frames or cells) are numbered, they can be placed back in the correct order before delivery to the user. Some protocols will even request a retransmission for any missing packets (frames or cells).</p><p>Network-switched is not a term found in networking.</p><p>Permanent virtual circuits is a term that describes a connection that is built across voice networks and remains in place, permanently.

They would help understand who has been accessing the business, but they would not stop, slow, or prevent unauthorized access.</p><p>Identification badges by themselves are not preventive. If there is a locked door that is opened with the possession of an identification badge, that would help. However, the question is about tailgating which is when someone walks in behind an authorized person. So, it is still a weaker control than turnstiles.</p><p>When guards are very diligent, and they are combined with badges, and doors that open only with the badge, they could help with tailgating. However, the answer only says guards. Guards by themselves should rarely be considered preventive as humans are distractable. So, a turnstile is a better control.</p>"

      "explanation": "<p>Correct answer:&nbsp;Adds replay resistance</p><p>A nonce (Number used Once) is a random number or value generated by the authentication server. When a client requests to authenticate, the server will reply with the nonce; this is often called the challenge. The client will combine the nonce with a predefined password and use a hashing algorithm to generate a response. The server will use the same nonce and predefined password to create a hash. If the hash generated by the client and server match, the server will authenticate the client. Each nonce can only be used once and helps prevent replay attacks.</p><p>The password should never be transmitted in clear text. The nonce makes the hash more effective which, by definition, removes the clear text password from the transmission. Random numbers such as nonces do help protect against rainbow table attacks. However, when discussing that random number, it is actually called a salt. It functions in much the same way as the nonce within Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) though. Hash collisions will occur. The way to prevent them is twofold, have a strong hashing algorithm with a larger message digest field, e.g. 512 bits long.</p>"
